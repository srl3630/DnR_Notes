# Security Engineering at Google: My Interview Study Notes

These notes were originally taken from [here](https://github.com/gracenolan/Notes)

The goal of this repo is to further my own knowledge and to expand upon some of the points I felt could use more color

This repo focuses mostly on the content, but if you're looking for interview advice, the original author has a great breakdown
