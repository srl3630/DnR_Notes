# Networking 

- OSI Model
	- Application; layer 7 (and basically layers 5 & 6) (includes API, HTTP, etc).
	- Transport; layer 4 (TCP/UDP).
	- Network; layer 3 (Routing).
	- Datalink; layer 2 (Error checking and frame synchronisation).
	- Physical; layer 1 (Bits over fibre).	
- Firewalls
	- Rules to prevent incoming and outgoing connections.	
- NAT 
	- Useful to understand IPv4 vs IPv6.
- DNS
	- (53)
	- Requests to DNS are usually UDP, unless the server gives a redirect notice asking for a TCP connection. Look up in cache happens first. DNS exfiltration. Using raw IP addresses means no DNS logs, but there are HTTP logs. DNS sinkholes.
      - TCP can also be ued when a DNS zone transfer to occur, which is when a secondary DNS server requests to replicate database from another DNS server
    - PTR reverses DNS lookups, going from IP -> Domain
- DNS exfiltration 
	- Sending data as subdomains. 
      - EX:26856485f6476a567567c6576e678.badguy.com
      - Can also be used to execute commands, by storing data in a txt record
	- Doesn’t show up in http logs, as no http request is made. 
- DNS configs
	- Start of Authority (SOA).
	- IP addresses (A and AAAA).
	- SMTP mail exchangers (MX).
	- Name servers (NS).
	- Pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR).
	- Domain name aliases (CNAME).
- ARP
	- Pair MAC address with IP Address for IP connections. 
- DHCP
	- UDP (67 - Server, 68 - Client)
	- Dynamic address allocation (allocated by router).
	- `DHCPDISCOVER` -> `DHCPOFFER` -> `DHCPREQUEST` -> `DHCPACK`
    - Assigns internal IP addresses to hosts
- Multiplex 
	- Timeshare, statistical share, just useful to know it exists.
- Traceroute 
	- Usually uses UDP, but might also use ICMP Echo Request or TCP SYN. TTL, or hop-limit.
	- Initial hop-limit is 128 for windows and 64 for *nix. Destination returns ICMP Echo Reply. 
- Nmap 
	- Network scanning tool.
- Intercepts (PitM - Person in the middle)
	- Understand PKI (public key infrastructure in relation to this).
- VPN 
	- Hide traffic from ISP but expose traffic to VPN provider.
- Tor 
	- Traffic is obvious on a network. 
	- How do organised crime investigators find people on tor networks.
      - Often times, the government will own a number of nodes on tor, if someone owns the entry and exit nodes, they can identify traffic that flows through it
- Proxy  
	- Why 7 proxies won’t help you.
      - Proxy doesn't hide/encrypt the data/what websites you're going to, just masks the original source
- BGP
	- Border Gateway Protocol.
	- Holds the internet together.
- Network traffic tools
	- Wireshark
	- Tcpdump
	- Burp suite
- HTTP/S

      - 80 is http, which is unencrypted
      - 443 is https and uses SSL/TLS
- SSL/TLS
	- (443) 
	- Super important to learn this, includes learning about handshakes, encryption, signing, certificate authorities, trust systems.

- "Insecure by exception"
	- When to allow people to do certain things for their job, and how to improve everything else. Don't try to "fix" security, just improve it by 99%.
- Do not blame the user
	- Security is about protecting people, we should build technology that people can trust, not constantly blame users. 


# Cryptography, Authentication, Identity 

- Encryption vs Encoding vs Hashing vs Obfuscation vs Signing
	- Be able to explain the differences between these things. 
	- [Various attack models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_model) (e.g. chosen-plaintext attack).

- Encryption standards + implementations
	- [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) (asymmetrical).
	- [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (symmetrical).
	- [ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) (namely ed25519) (asymmetric).
	- [Chacha/Salsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant) (symmetric).

- Asymmetric vs symmetric
	- Asymmetric is slow, but good for establishing a trusted connection.
	- Symmetric has a shared key and is faster. Protocols often use asymmetric to transfer symmetric key.
	- Perfect forward secrecy - eg Signal uses this.

- Cyphers
	- Block vs stream [ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher).
	- [Block cipher modes of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation).
	- [AES-GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode).

- Integrity and authenticity primitives
	- [Hashing functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) e.g. MD5, Sha-1, BLAKE. Used for identifiers, very useful for fingerprinting malware samples.
	- [Message Authentication Codes (MACs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code).
	- [Keyed-hash MAC (HMAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC).

		- Look at DigiNotar.
	- Trusted Platform Module 
		- (TPM)
		- Trusted storage for certs and auth data locally on device/host.
	- O-auth
		- Bearer tokens, this can be stolen and used, just like cookies.
	- Auth Cookies
		- Client side.
	- Sessions 
		- Server side.
	- Auth systems

	- Compare and contrast multi-factor auth methods.

- Identity
	- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
		- Control which authenicated users can access which resources.
	- Service accounts vs User accounts
		- Robot accounts or Service accounts are used for automation.
		- Service accounts should have heavily restricted priviledges.
		- Understanding how Service accounts are used by attackers is important for understanding Cloud security.  
	- impersonation
		- Exported account keys.

# Detection

- IDS
	- Intrusion Detection System (signature based (eg. snort) or behaviour based).
	- Snort/Suricata/YARA rule writing
	- Host-based Intrusion Detection System (eg. OSSEC)

- SIEM
	- Security Information and Event Management.

- IOC 
	- Indicator of compromise (often shared amongst orgs/groups).
	- Specific details (e.g. IP addresses, hashes, domains)

- Things that create signals
	- Honeypots, snort.

- Things that triage signals
	- SIEM, eg splunk.

- Things that will alert a human 
	- Automatic triage of collated logs, machine learning.
	- Notifications and analyst fatigue.
	- Systems that make it easy to decide if alert is actual hacks or not.

- Signatures
	- Host-based signatures
		- Eg changes to the registry, files created or modified.
		- Strings in found in malware samples appearing in binaries installed on hosts (/Antivirus).
	- Network signatures
		- Eg checking DNS records for attempts to contact C2 (command and control) servers. 

- Anomaly / Behaviour based detection 
	- IDS learns model of “normal” behaviour, then can detect things that deviate too far from normal - eg unusual urls being accessed, user specific- login times / usual work hours, normal files accessed.  
	- Can also look for things that a hacker might specifically do (eg, HISTFILE commands, accessing /proc).
	- If someone is inside the network- If action could be suspicious, increase log verbosity for that user.

- Firewall rules
	- Brute force (trying to log in with a lot of failures).
	- Detecting port scanning (could look for TCP SYN packets with no following SYN ACK/ half connections).
	- Antivirus software notifications.
	- Large amounts of upload traffic.

- Honey pots
	- Canary tokens.
	- Dummy internal service / web server, can check traffic, see what attacker tries.

- Things to know about attackers
	- Slow attacks are harder to detect.
	- Attacker can spoof packets that look like other types of attacks, deliberately create a lot of noise.
	- Attacker can spoof IP address sending packets, but can check TTL of packets and TTL of reverse lookup to find spoofed addresses.
	- Correlating IPs with physical location (is difficult and inaccurate often).

- Logs to look at
	- DNS queries to suspicious domains.
	- HTTP headers could contain wonky information.
	- Metadata of files (eg. author of file) (more forensics?).
	- Traffic volume.
	- Traffic patterns.
	- Execution logs.

- Detection related tools
	- Splunk.
	- Arcsight.
	- Qradar.
	- Darktrace.
	- Tcpdump.
	- Wireshark.
	- Zeek.
